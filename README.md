### Project 2: [“Exploring Toronto Neighborhoods to Identify a Suitable Location for a New Indian Restaurant”](https://github.com/Amy-Reidy/Portfolio/blob/main/IBM%20Capstone%20Project%20-%20Exploring%20Indian%20Restaurants%20in%20Toronto.ipynb)

This was my first ever data science project, which I did as part of the capstone project for IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate.

The aim of the project is to to investigate where would be a suitable location for a new Indian restaurant in Toronto, based on the density of existing Indian restaurants and the number of Indian residents in each neighborhood.
