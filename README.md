### Project 2: [“Exploring Toronto Neighborhoods to Identify a Suitable Location for a New Indian Restaurant”](https://github.com/Amy-Reidy/Portfolio/blob/main/IBM%20Capstone%20Project%20-%20Exploring%20Indian%20Restaurants%20in%20Toronto.ipynb)

This was my first ever data science project, which I did as part of the capstone project for IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate in November 2020.

The aim of the project was to investigate where would be a suitable location for a new Indian restaurant in Toronto, based on the density of existing Indian restaurants and the number of Indian residents in each neighborhood.

Data was sourced by webscraping Wikipedia, extracting information about various venues in Toronto and their geospatial information using Foursquare’s API, and obtaining geospatial for Toronto from “https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data”.

The K-means machine learning model was used to group the neighborhoods into clusters based on the density of Indian restaurants in each neighborhood.

Libraries used: *pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, requests, geopy, folium, wikipedia, yellowbrick*
